Implemented as a library rather than an inde- pendent client/server system, the Record Layer can be em- bedded in its client, imposing few requirements on how the actual server is implemented. Since FoundationDB is most performant at high levels of concurrency, nearly all of the Record Layer’s operations are implemented asynchronously and pipelined where possible. We also make extensive use of FoundationDB-specific features, such as controllable isola- tion semantics, both within the layer’s implementation and exposed to clients via its API.\\n\\ntransaction, provides continuations to resume work, and can be coupled with external throttling. On the data level, the keys of each record store start with a unique binary prefix which defines a FoundationDB subspace.

       " Document(page_content='ABSTRACT The FoundationDB Record Layer is an open source library that provides a record-oriented data store with semantics similar to a relational database implemented on top of Foun- dationDB, an ordered, transactional key-value store. The Record Layer provides a lightweight, highly extensible way to store structured data. It offers schema management and a rich set of query and indexing facilities, some of which are not usually found in traditional relational databases, such as nested record types, indexes on commit versions, and in- dexes that span multiple record types. The Record Layer is stateless and built for massive multi-tenancy, encapsulating and isolating all of a tenant’s state, including indexes, into a separate logical database. We demonstrate how the Record Layer is used by CloudKit, Apple’s cloud backend service, to provide powerful abstractions to applications serving hun- dreds of millions of users. CloudKit uses the Record Layer to host billions of independent', metadata={'source': '/home/jovyan/data/record-layer-paper.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='12 CONCLUSIONS The FoundationDB Record Layer offers rich features sim- ilar to those of a relational database, including structured schema, indexing, and declarative queries. Because it is built on FounationDB, it inherits its ACID transactions, reliability, and performance. The core record store abstraction encapsu- lates a database and makes it easy to operate the Record Layer in a massively multi-tenant environment. The Record Layer offers deep extensibility, allowing clients to add features such as custom index types. At Apple, we leverage these capabil- ities to implement CloudKit, which uses the Record Layer to offer new features (e.g., transactional full-text indexing), speed up key operations (e.g., with high-concurrency zones), and simplify application development (e.g., with interactive transactions) across billions of databases.', metadata={'source': '/home/jovyan/data/record-layer-paper.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Record Layer leverages details of FoundationDB’s implementation to improve data access speed. For example, record prefetching asynchronously preloads records into the FoundationDB client’s read-your-write cache, but does not return them to the client application. When reading batches of many records, this can potentially save a context switch and record deserialization.
